# case_study-student_sectioning

### Case study student sectioning - part of the grade of the module "Practical Course Management Science".

**This work was done with the help of another team member.**
For detailed tasks description, see "Task Sheet for Case Study.pdf" and "Description_Student sectioning Case Study.pdf".

The task was to assign n students to m courses. This was to be done in a way that was as responsive as possible to the preferences of the students, but at the same time adhered to various constraints, such as maximum and minimum number of participants, etc. We developed an optimization model that minimizes a cost function and thus tries to allocate students to courses in the best possible way.

Data for this was randomly generated in Excel and then processed via CPLEX Optimization Studio. This optimization was performed for several data sets with different parameters; the results were then analyzed and discussed in the research paper.
